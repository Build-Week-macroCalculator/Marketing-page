        <h2>What are Macros?</h2>
        <p>Macros, also known as macronutrients, are the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that you eat on a daily basis. Beyond simple calorie counting, a macronutrient-based diet, ensures that your body is provided with a healthy amount of nutrients from each category.</p>

        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>Carbohydrates (carbs) include sugars, starches and fibers. Most types of carbs get broken down into glucose, or blood sugar, which your body either uses for immediate energy or stores as glycogen — the storage form of glucose — in your liver and muscles.</p> 
        <p>Carbs provide 4 calories per gram and typically make up the largest portion of people’s calorie intake. Carb intake is among the most hotly debated of all macronutrient recommendations, but major health organizations suggest consuming 45–65% of your daily calories from carbs. Carbohydrates are found in foods like grains, starchy vegetables, beans, dairy products and fruits.</p>

            <h2>Fats</h2>
            <p>Fats have the most calories of all macronutrients, providing 9 calories per gram. Your body needs fat for energy and critical functions, such as hormone production, nutrient absorption and body temperature maintenance.</p>
            <p>Though typical macronutrient recommendations for fats range from 20–35% of total calories, many people find success following a diet higher in fat. Fats are found in foods like oils, butter, avocado, nuts, meat and fatty fish.</p>

            <h2>Proteins</h2>
            <p>Like carbs, proteins provide 4 calories per gram. Proteins are vital for processes like cell signaling, immune function and the building of tissues, hormones and enzymes.</p>
            <p>It’s recommended that proteins comprise 10–35% of your total calorie intake (4Trusted Source). However, protein recommendations vary depending on body composition goals, age, health and more. Examples of protein-rich foods include eggs, poultry, fish, tofu and lentils.</p>
